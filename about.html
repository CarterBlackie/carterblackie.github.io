    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a third-year Bachelor of Computer Science student at Conestoga College with a strong interest in software engineering and a drive to turn ideas into working solutions. I thrive on combining technical skills with real-world experience — 
      whether it’s writing clean code or helping customers solve tech issues face-to-face.
    </p>
    </p>
      Recently, I started a new role at Jefferson Elora Corporation in the Material Services department, where I’m gaining valuable hands-on experience in logistics and manufacturing operations. 
      It’s been a great opportunity to understand how large-scale systems run behind the scenes, and how efficiency, safety, and teamwork come together to drive production forward.
    </p>
    </p>
      Previously, I worked at Best Buy, where I balanced warehouse operations with customer service in the electronics department. I supported customers with product recommendations and troubleshooting, while collaborating with a team of 20+ staff 
      and Geek Squad technicians to ensure great service.
    </p>
    </p>
      In the classroom, I’m building strong foundations in Python, Java, and C#, with a growing focus on web development and object-oriented design. I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, continue learning from 
      experienced developers, and contribute to projects that create real impact.
    </p>
